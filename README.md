Creating Solar System Visualization
This project is a simple HTML and CSS representation of a solar system, showcasing the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Earth, along with an orbiting moon around Mercury. The project is designed to illustrate basic concepts of web development, including the use of animations, positioning, and styling to create a visually engaging model.

Features
* Sun: Represented as a central, glowing orb with a realistic color and shadow effect.
* Mercury: Orbits around the Sun with a defined path and a smaller moon that also orbits Mercury.
* Venus: Positioned with an orbital path around the Sun, distinct in color and size.
* Earth: Another orbiting planet, styled with a unique color.

Technologies Used
* HTML: Structure of the solar system model.
* CSS: Styling and animations to create the orbiting effect and visual appeal.
